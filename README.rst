Python Autocrypt repository
==============================================

This respository offers the following functionality:

- python autocrypt package to create and manage Autocrypt
  account directories and process incoming and outgoing mails,
  see `core/README.rst <core/README.rst>`_.

- autocrypt command line with sub commands for creating
  and managing Autocrypt account directories and process
  incoming and outgoing mails.
  see `core/README.rst <core/README.rst>`_.

- (in-progress) a simple bot implementation which can be
  deployed to properly answer Autocrypt mails, parsing
  headers from peers and sending (possibly encrypted) replies
  which reflect to the sender what the bot perceived in terms
  of autocrypt information.
