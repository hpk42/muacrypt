<h3>About Autocrypt</h3>
<p>
  Autocrypt replaces the use of cleartext with
  end-to-end encrypted e-mail. We encourage
  adoption by radically simplifying user experience 
  and by using in-band opportunistic key discovery.
  See <a href="https://github.com/autocrypt/autocrypt/">autocrypt/autocrypt
  github repo</a> for the source.
