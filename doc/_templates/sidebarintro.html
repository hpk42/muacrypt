<h3>About Autocrypt</h3>
<p>
  Autocrypt is a project to replace the use of unencrypted e-mail with
  opportunistic end-to-end encrypted e-mail.  We aim to encourage
  adoption by radically simplifying the expected user experience, and
  using in-band opportunistic key discovery.
  See <a href="https://github.com/mailencrypt/autocrypt/">mailencrypt/autocrypt
  github repo</a> for the source.
